This work describes several infrastructure contributions aimed to simplify the deployment of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) 
environments so that elderly people can maximize the time they live independently, through the help of ICT, at their own homes. 
Three core contributions are reviewed: a) a multi-layered OSGi-based middleware architecture which enables adding new environment 
monitoring and actuating devices seamlessly, b) an easy-to-use elderly-accessible front-end to comfortably control from a touch 
screen environment services together with a custom-built alert bracelet to seek assistance anywhere at any time and c) a 
rule-based engine which allows the configuration of the reactive behaviour of an environment as a set of rules.
