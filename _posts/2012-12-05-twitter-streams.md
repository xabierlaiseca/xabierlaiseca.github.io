Increasingly, more important information is being shared through Twitter. New opportunities arise to use this tool 
to detect emergencies and extract crucial information about the scope and nature of that event. A major challenge 
for the extraction of emergency event information from Twitter is represented by the unstructured and noisy nature of 
tweets. Within the SABESS project we propose a combined structural and content based analysis approach. We use social 
network analysis to identify reliable tweets and content analysis techniques to summarize key emergency facts.
