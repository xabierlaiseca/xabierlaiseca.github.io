Context in an environment usually suffers from sudden changes; people and devices move from one place to another, previously unknown objects 
appear and existing ones disappear. AmI-enhanced environments must be flexible enough to adapt and respond to these changes. This work 
describes a semantic infrastructure which manages context, reasons over it and, more significantly, it is capable of dynamically enriching 
the ontology that models context.
