Since Sir Tim Berners-Lee announced the best practices to publish semantic data through the Web, 
Linked Data principles have been introduced into a wide variety of application domains. This usage 
of Linked Data eases the enrichment of offered data in a grade that the semantic data that not 
applies the Linked Data principles never would achieve. In this paper, we present LinkedQR1 , a tool 
to improve the collaboration between QR codes and Linked Data; and a case study based on the tourism 
sector located into an art gallery.
