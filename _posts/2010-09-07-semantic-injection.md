As new challenges motivated by the Semantic Web get resolved, the need for getting protected against new types of security 
flaws becomes critical. In the Semantic Web the old and well-known vulnerabilities reappear with all the power of the new 
semantic mechanisms. This semantic mechanisms older new and dangerous possibilities to malicious users. For this reason it 
is important for the developers to know and prevent the vulnerabilities in their applications. In this paper we analyze the 
possibilities of injection attacks in the most used semantic query / update languages (SPARQL/SPARUL).
