The use of passive HF RFID tags in healthcare environments is by no means new. However, RFID tags' user-writable data 
storage capability is often not used in favour of an over-the-network data access approach. Thus, RFID tags are usually 
relegated to mere remote data identifiers. This paper explores the potential of actually using the storage capability 
of an RFID tag as a portable database of the latest events in the life of a patient in an AAL-enabled environment; both 
from a theoretical approach, encompassing studies on the actual data storage capacity on HF RFID tags; as well as a 
practical one, describing our proposal for an NFC-powered platform that uses the data-on- tag paradigm to be used in 
environments where: a) the mentioned portable patient logs can lead to improvements on patient attention and quality 
of treatment; and b) a continuous data link approach is not technically or economically feasible.
