AmI environments are dynamic. They change rapidly and continuously due to the appearance and disappearance of devices, 
people and changes in their situation. These changes need to be reflected in the context information which is collected 
and maintained by the Ambient Intelligence applications. In this work we present a semantic infrastructure whose context 
information can be dynamically enriched and extended by the dynamically discovered objects in the environment, and which 
enables to reason over it.
