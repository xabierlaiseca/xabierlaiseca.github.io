This paper describes the architecture and components of an AAL-enabling platform, centred around interactive TV (iTV), which
combines OSGi middleware, RFID and NFC in order to ease the day to day of dependant or semi-dependant elderly people (its main 
focus), their care takers and relatives. The end result is an affordable, unobtrusive, evolvable, usable and easily deployable 
ICT infrastructure which aims to approach the vision of “AAL for All”. This is, it seeks a more widespread adoption of AAL and 
a better QoS on caretaking through the combination of common hardware, OSGi dynamic service and mobile-aided care data management.
