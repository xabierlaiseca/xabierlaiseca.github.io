Distributed architectures mean significant benefits for many scenarios. However, they also entail difficulties and problems 
because of their intrinsic nature. Moreover, these environments don’t support any semantics by themselves, becoming necessary 
the implementation of additional solutions for knowledge representation and management. As a result, new troubles arise, as 
integration and management related. This work proposes the use of a Triple Spaces solution for integrating any semantic and 
distributed environment. Particulary, it outlines how two very different scenarios have been implemented under the Triple 
Spaces paradigm.
