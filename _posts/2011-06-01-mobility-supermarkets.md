People's impairments cause a wide range of difficulties in everyday tasks. Particularly, handicapped people face 
many challenges both at home, but especially outside it, where their reduced mobility is a burden. Buying in a 
supermarket can be sometimes troublesome for them and so as to facilitate this task, a product locator application 
is proposed. This application runs on heterogeneous personal mobile devices keeping the user private information 
safe on them, and it locates the desired products over each supermarket's map.
