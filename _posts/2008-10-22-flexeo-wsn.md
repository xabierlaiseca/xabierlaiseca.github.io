Wireless sensor networks are a hot topic in Ubiquitous Computing for implementing context-awareness scenarios. The connection 
of sensor nodes to the Internet leads to new ways for remote monitoring of human behavior in real-time. In this paper, we 
introduce Flexeo: a flexible architecture for implementing monitoring solutions based on wireless sensor networks, with 
distributed intelligence at different layers. In this way, sensor-populated scenarios may communicate with Internet-based 
facilities enabling the vision of an Internet of Things.
