This paper describes an AAL-enabling platform which combines OSGi middleware, interactive TV, RFID and NFC in order to ease 
the day to day of not only dependant or semi-dependant elderly people (its main focus) but also their care takers and 
relatives. The end result is an affordable, unobtrusive, evolvable, usable and easily deployable ICT infrastructure which 
aims to approach the vision of "AAL for All".
