The increase of life expectancy has arisen new challenges related with the amount of resources required to attend 
elderly people with cognitive disabilities. These requirements, such as medical staff and financial resources, have 
been multiplied in the last years, and this tendency will continue in the forthcoming ones. In order to reduce these 
requirements, the introduction of new technologies will be a key aspect. In this paper we propose a test-question-based 
memory game that collects the answers given by patients and facilitates access to this information to caregivers and relatives.
