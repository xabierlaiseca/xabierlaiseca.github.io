This work describes an OSGi-based middleware platform to enable more scalable, future-proof, cost-efficient and standard-following 
intelligent environments. It complements OSGi with two main features which make it even more suitable for intelligent environment 
management: a) dynamic discovery and monitoring of distributed semantic services and b) semantic context modelling and reasoning 
for intelligent service provision. Furthermore, it evaluates the suitability of applying semantic technologies in the construction 
of intelligent environment middleware.
